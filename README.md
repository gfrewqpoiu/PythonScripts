Python Scripts

In this repository, I have collected some small Python scripts, that I wrote to help me achieve some tasks easier.

* Rclone.py is a small WIP wrapper around Rclone.
* Video_convert is a small WIP wrapper around HandBrakeCLI.

If you want to run any of these, I recommend using pipenv and pyenv. 
`pipenv install --deploy` should install everything you need.
